      <title>Stable isotope insights into microplastic contamination within freshwater food webs</title>
      <link>https://ardcarvalho.github.io/post/article_sia/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We quantified the trophic niche of individuals (macroinvertebrates and fish) to investigate the correlation with the microplastic concentration and features presented in their body - intestinal tract (for fish). We also compared the microplastic pollution (abiotic compartment) and the microplastic contamination (biotic contamination).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Urbanization and hydrological conditions drive the spatial and temporal variability of microplastic polution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this high spatial and temporal resolution study, we resumed the environmental variables (through PCA) that could affect the variability of environmental microplastic pollution. Then, we investigated the environmental drivers, by mixed effect models, of the spatial and temporal variability in microplastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At PLASTIGAR project, a collaboration between &lt;a href=&#34;http://imrcp.ups-tlse.fr/&#34;&gt;IMRCP&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://edb.cnrs.fr/&#34;&gt;EDB&lt;/a&gt; laboratories from Paul Sabatier University (Toulouse, France), we were interested in understanding the drivers of the spatial and temporal variability of microplastic pollution. Also, how this pollution is affected by a flood episode and the ecological determinants of microplastic ingestion by aquatic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zebrafish water tank model (ZWT): a tool for human-like metabolism studies</title>
      <link>https://ardcarvalho.github.io/post/zwt/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zebrafish (&lt;em&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/em&gt;) water tank (ZWT) approach was investigated as an alternative model for metabolism studies, based on six different experiments with four model compounds. Also, we were interested on the impact of steroid hormones on the endogenous metabolism of zebrafish. We discuss the appropriate conditions, merits, and relevant limitations to conduct ZWT experiments for the investigation of drug metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
